User Guide
Getting Started:

Don't try to set up and use everything at once. Get to know how trackers work before making one private or setting up reminders.
You should have an idea of something you want to track, and how the values work - do you know the exact number (car odometer), or is it more fuzzy (how happy am I) so better with a slider?
Tap the '+' in the top right corner to add a new tracker
Name the tracker
Add some values to be tracked. Each value needs a name. Select the type from the chooser, or just leave it as a number. Don't worry about the graph color or graph type until you want to change it.
Tap 'Save' in the top right corner and get back to the list of trackers.
Use your new tracker.
Tap the name of your tracker in the list.
Fill in the values.
Adjust the date for the entry if you want by tapping the date at the bottom of the screen. You're not allowed to set a date in the future.
Tap 'Save' in the top right corner to save and return to your list.
Review your tracked data.
Tap the name of your tracer in the list.
Turn your device sideways to see the graph of your data. There won't be anything to show until you have saved a few entries.
Tap the left of the screen to cycle through highlighting the different values.
Tap a point on the graph to go to that date when you rotate back to portrait orientation.
Turn your device back to portrait orientation to return to the tracker.
Swipe right to go to previous entries, left to go to future entries.
Use the calendar icon at the bottom of the screen to see dates with data. Tap a date to go to that day's first entry. You will have to swipe left to get to later entries on that day.
